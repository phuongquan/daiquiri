Description: Generate reports that enable quick visual review of 
    temporal shifts in record-level data. Time series plots showing aggregated 
    values are automatically created for each column depending on its 
    datatype (e.g. min/max/mean values for numeric columns, no. of distinct 
    values for categorical columns), as well as overviews for missing values, 
    non-conformant values, and duplicated rows. It is designed with Electronic 
    Health Records in mind, but can be used for any type of record-level temporal data.
