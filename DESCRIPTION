Description: Generate reports that enable quick visual review of 
    temporal shifts in record-level data. Time series plots showing aggregated 
    values are automatically created for each data field (column) depending on its 
    contents (e.g. min/max/mean values for numeric data, no. of distinct 
    values for categorical data), as well as overviews for missing values, 
    non-conformant values, and duplicated rows. The resulting reports are sharable 
    and can contribute to forming a transparent record of the entire analysis process. 
    It is designed with Electronic Health Records in mind, but can be used for 
    any type of record-level temporal data (i.e. tabular data where each row represents 
    a single “event”, one column contains the "event date", and other columns 
    contain any associated values for the event).
