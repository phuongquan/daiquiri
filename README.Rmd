# daiquiri

The daiquiri package generates data quality reports that enable quick visual review of temporal shifts in record-level data. Time series plots showing aggregated values are automatically created for each data field (column) depending on its contents (e.g. min/max/mean values for numeric data, no. of distinct values for categorical data), as well as overviews for missing values, non-conformant values, and duplicated rows.

Essentially, it takes input such as this:

<img src="man/figures/example_data_head.png" width="700" />

And outputs this:

<img src="man/figures/example_data_aggregated_valuespresent.png" width="350" /><img src="man/figures/example_data_allfields_missing_perc.png" width="350" />

The resulting html reports are shareable and can contribute to forming a transparent record of the entire analysis process. It is designed with electronic health records in mind, but can be used for any type of record-level temporal data.

## Why should I use it?

Large routinely-collected datasets are increasingly being used in research. However, given their data are collected for operational rather than research purposes, there is a greater-than-usual need for them to be checked for data quality issues before any analyses are conducted. Events occurring at the institutional level such as software updates, new machinery or processes can cause temporal artefacts that, if not identified and taken into account, can lead to biased results and incorrect conclusions. For example, the figures below show real data from a large hospital in the UK.

<img src="man/figures/antibiotics_day_DurationEnteredByPrescriber_missing_perc.png" width="350" /><img src="man/figures/bchem_creatinine_day_Value_mean.png" width="350" />

The first figure  shows the percentage of missing values in the 'Duration' field of a dataset containing antibiotic prescriptions, and the second figure shows the mean value of all laboratory tests checking for levels of 'creatinine' in the blood. As you can see, these values can sometimes change suddenly and unnaturally, and researchers need to take this into account if comparing or combining the data before and after these 'change points'.

While these checks should theoretically be conducted by the researcher at the initial data analysis stage, in practice it is unclear to what extent this is actually done, since it is rarely, if ever, reported in published papers. With the increasing drive towards greater transparency and reproducibility within the scientific community, this essential yet often-overlooked part of the analysis process will inevitably begin to come under greater scrutiny. The daiquiri package helps researchers conduct this part of the process more thoroughly, consistently and transparently, hence increasing the quality of their studies as well as trust in the scientific process.

## Getting started

The intention is to make daiquiri available in CRAN but until then, you can install the latest release by running the following:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("https://github.com/phuongquan/daiquiri/releases/download/v0.6.1/daiquiri_0.6.1.tar.gz", 
								 repos = NULL, type = "source")
```

NOTE: Depending on what packages you already have installed, it may return an error saying that certain dependencies are not available for the package. It will not install these automatically. Once you have installed the dependencies from CRAN, try to install the package again.

Once installed, the walkthrough vignette guides you through how to use the package:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
vignette("walkthrough", package = "daiquiri")
```

Alternatively, you can install the current development version from GitHub (though this may be more buggy):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("phuongquan/daiquiri", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
